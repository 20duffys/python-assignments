# Assignment 4 - Final Project!

## The Proposal

*Due: TBD*

See this sample project proposal for an example of what we’re looking for.

When you turn in your project to us, please make a copy of this template and share it with us (allowing us to View + Comment). Proposals in Google Doc formats are preferred so we can comment on the proposals and give feedback quickly.

## The Project

*Due: TBD*

Implement the project you have proposed, incorporating feedback that we will return to you by Monday, November 9th.

We’ll have a midpoint check in before Thanksgiving - asking your team to send us an update on where you guys are in your projects.

All final projects will be due before class on 11/17, just in time for presentations that will be during class on 11/17 and 11/19!

### Development Strategy and Hints
Have a plan. We're making you submit a project proposal so that you think about potential challenges and your plan to overcome them.

Start small and iterate quickly. Python, unlike many other languages, allows you to rapidly iterate by developing your code in small steps through the interactive interpreter.

Build incrementally and test frequently! This project will likely be the largest Python project you have written, so make sure each task works before moving on!

### Starter Code

For this assignment, we are not explicitly providing any code to you.

We are publishing a beta version of the `stanford` library,

You are free to use any builtin modules, publicly available code, or any code you find online, as long as you cite it appropriately. Use Google and StackOverflow a lot! Chances are that someone has built a library to help with your project.

You may *not* use proprietary code, code which requires a paid license, anything which promotes illegal activity, etc.

## The Presentation

## Grading

Your grade will be assessed on both functionality and style.

Functionality will be determined entirely by your program's correctness on a suite of unit tests (some of which are provided with the starter code).

Stylistically, you will be evaluated on your general program design (a la 106 series: decomposition, logic, etc) as well as your Python-specific style. In particular, we will be looking for "Pythonic" approaches to solving problems, as opposed to "non-Pythonic" solutions, that emphasize the Zen of Python. We will also be looking at your Python syntax and mechanics. We encourage you to format your code in accordance with [Python style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). You can find a tool to help format your code [online](http://pep8online.com/).

## Submitting

Submit your code, as usual, using the `submit` script on the Stanford computer networks (`myth`, `corn`, etc.). As well as any necessary dependencies, using the `submit` script on AFS.
