# Assignment 4: Final Project!

## The Proposal

*Due: Friday, May 20th at 11:59:59 PM*

![THe Proposal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stanfordpython/python-assignments/master/assign4/proposal.png)

As described in class, the purpose of the project proposal is for the course staff to ensure that the project is well-scoped and incorporates Python in some meaningful way. We can also suggest useful packages for your project. The better your proposal, the more we can assist you by pointing you away from common pitfalls and towards good solutions.

You should use [`template.md`](https://github.com/stanfordpython/python-assignments/blob/master/assign4/template.md) as a starting template for your proposal. See [`sampleproposal.md`](https://github.com/stanfordpython/python-assignments/blob/master/assign4/sampleproposal.md) for an example of what we’re looking for. We've added some ideas to [`ideas.md`](https://github.com/stanfordpython/python-assignments/blob/master/assign4/ideas.md) if you're stuck.

In order to submit the proposal, drop your file into our [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-eHIhYpHrGDdHJzclFoem1rR1E). When we review your proposals, we'll look at the most recently added proposal.

*Note: you can use late days on the project proposal, but hopefully you will complete this on time so that we can get feedback to you more quickly.*

## The Project

*Due: Sunday, May 29th at 11:59:59 PM*

Implement the project you have proposed, incorporating feedback that we will return to you by Monday, May 23rd at the latest.

We’ll have a midpoint check in before Thanksgiving - asking your team to send us an update on where you guys are in your projects.

*Note: you can only use up to one late day on this project, so that we can read through all the projects before presentations begin!*

### Development Strategy and Hints

Have a plan. We're making you submit a project proposal so that you think about potential challenges and your plan to overcome them.

Start small and iterate quickly. Python, unlike many other languages, allows you to rapidly iterate by developing your code in small steps through the interactive interpreter.

Build incrementally and test frequently! This project will likely be the largest Python project you have written, so make sure each task works before moving on!

### Deliverables

In addition to your code, you should submit a `README.md` file as a writeup of your final project.

### Starter Code

For this assignment, we are not explicitly providing any code to you. We have been working on an early alpha release of a `stanford` package that makes CS106A/B/X-style functionality (graphics, sound) available in Python 3. The software hasn't been tested much, and is surely buggy, but if you'd like to work with our development libraries, let us know.

You are free to use any builtin modules, publicly available code, or any code you find online, as long as you cite it appropriately. Use Google and StackOverflow a lot! Chances are that someone has built a library to help with your project.

You may *not* use proprietary code, code which requires a paid license, anything which promotes illegal activity, etc.

## Grading

The project proposal grade will be assessed purely on completion. Did you do it? Great! If not - less great. 

Your grade will be assessed on both functionality and style.

Functionality will be determined entirely by your program's correctness on a suite of unit tests (some of which are provided with the starter code).

Stylistically, you will be evaluated on your general program design (a la 106 series: decomposition, logic, etc) as well as your Python-specific style. In particular, we will be looking for "Pythonic" approaches to solving problems, as opposed to "non-Pythonic" solutions, that emphasize the Zen of Python. We will also be looking at your Python syntax and mechanics. We encourage you to format your code in accordance with [Python style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). You can find a tool to help format your code [online](http://pep8online.com/).

## Submitting

Submit your code, as usual, using the `submit` script on the Stanford computer networks (`myth`, `corn`, etc.). As well as any necessary dependencies, using the `submit` script on AFS.
