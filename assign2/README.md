*READ COMPLETELY BEFORE STARTING THE ASSIGNMENT*

Congratulations on a great quarter thus far. However, now it's time to put what you have learned to the test. The staff have created a gauntlet of test for you to accomplish. Trials and tribulations that will seperate the Dutch from the less-Dutch.

The theme of this assignment is simple "Pass the Class"

First you will assemble your schedule: To pass this guantlet simply clone the source code and attempt to enroll in as many classes as possible. The correct set of classes in chronological order will provide you with a token that you will then use to complete the following link:

Before you move on to part two however, be sure to fill out the form that is linked in the completed.txt file so we know how far along you are.

Now that you have your schedule for next quarter, you realize you have a lab that you need to complete in order to pass a Bio Lab. Solve the DNA puzzle and sum together the answers to the problems in dna.txt to get the password that unlocks the final test.

Before you move on make sure you fill out the *different* form that is linked in the completed.txt file in second puzzle folder so we know how far along you are.

Now that you have your password you can unlock the final level. The zip file in your assign2 directory will only open with your password and can only be attempted 10 times. Tread lightly.

Now that you have your final piece of the puzzle solve the final puzzle to determine where your prize will be located. 
As always, fill out the third form in the final folder to let us know how far along you are.

Once you have reached the final location take a picture and send it to us so we know you have completed the gauntlet.
